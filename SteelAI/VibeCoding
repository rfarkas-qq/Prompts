## Iteration 1

Create a professional LinkedIn post that uses a formal but approachable tone and tells a concise story about a specific event, achievement, or experience. Emphasize the real impact on innovation, technology adoption, or digital transformation. Highlight collaboration, communities, or cross-industry/academia connections. Include clear recognition of partners, organizers, or colleagues. Add a forward-looking takeaway showing why the topic matters for the future. Keep the message positive, structured, and oriented toward progress and shared learning. Modify this: Our digital community of US Steel had the opportunity to welcome Igor from TechBand, who introduced us to the world of Vibe Coding. We began with the fundamentals, but quickly shifted into practice and built our own applications. Even with 130 persons - mainly non-programmers - in the room, we managed to create websites — from movie-review blogs to small webshops offering bouquets. We then briefly explored how Vibe Coding connects to “real” development through concepts like unit testing and code reviews. Of course we do not want to develop enterprise applications like that (yet). But the session gave us a clear picture of how this approach can support faster and safer internal application development, or help us build cleaner, more engaging Power BI reports. User - requestor of new application - can have few iterations wit AI. Test his requirement 'live' - simulating behaving of screens, before involving of human developer. We also see strong potential to extend these “vibes” into our IT development teams as part of our broader digital journey. Many thanks to Igor for an inspiring and hands-on experience.

## Result

Our digital community at U. S. Steel recently had the opportunity to welcome Igor from TechBand, who introduced us to the world of Vibe Coding. After a short dive into the fundamentals, we moved straight into hands-on creation. With more than 130 participants — a mix of colleagues joining online and in person, most of them non-programmers — we built functional web applications ranging from movie-review blogs to small webshops with surprising ease.
We also touched on how Vibe Coding links to established software practices such as unit testing and code reviews, providing a bridge between rapid prototyping and “real” development. While this is not how we aim to build enterprise systems, the session clearly showed how AI-driven iteration can accelerate early-stage application design and help refine user requirements before a developer ever writes a line of code. The same principles can support cleaner, more interactive Power BI solutions or speed up internal tooling.
Looking ahead, we see strong potential to bring these capabilities into our IT development teams and strengthen our broader digital transformation. Approaches like this can deepen collaboration between users, analysts, and developers, and help us innovate faster and more safely.
Many thanks to Igor and TechBand for an inspiring, highly practical session.
