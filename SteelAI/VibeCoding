Our digital community recently had the opportunity to welcome Igor from TechBand, who introduced us to the world of Vibe Coding. 
We began with the fundamentals, but quickly shifted into practice and built our own applications.

Even with non-programmers in the room, we managed to create websites — from movie-review blogs 
to small webshops offering bouquets. We then explored how Vibe Coding connects to “real” development through concepts 
like unit testing and code reviews.

The session gave us a clear picture of how this approach can support faster and safer internal application development, 
or help us build cleaner, more engaging Power BI reports. We also see strong potential to extend these “vibes” 
into our IT development teams as part of our broader digital journey.

Many thanks to Igor for an inspiring and hands-on experience.
